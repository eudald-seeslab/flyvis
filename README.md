# Flyvis ü™∞

A connectome constrained deep mechanistic network (DMN) model of the fruit fly visual system in Pytorch as discovery tool for generating
and testing hypotheses about neural computations with connectomes.

It's our official implementation of [üìÑConnectome-constrained deep mechanistic networks predict neural responses across the fly visual system at single-neuron resolution](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.11.532232v1).

Besides pretrained models and analyses, the library includes abstractions and
extension points for building DMNs and dynamic stimulus datasets in Pytorch.

## Get started üöÄ

To illustrate how we generate hypotheses about neural computations with DMNs
we include two examples. The examples
explore the connectome and how to provide custom stimuli to the models and
explore their responses. Try our models inside our Google Colab notebooks:

- [Explore the connectome](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16xi96XS3whNhwMNeFihBNNgADVh60XHH?usp=sharing)
- [Provide custom stimuli](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xBJ-xLgmLGhXgkf8XLw2PRRlDrYQ1Hhv?usp=sharing)

All in between, touching
results already described in the paper, will come soon.

## Watch for more to come üîú

## Install locally üë©‚Äçüíªüßë‚Äçüíª

For installing the package locally, follow the steps below (assuming conda is installed):

1. create a new conda environment `conda create --name flyvision -y`
2. activate the new conda environment `conda activate flyvision`
3. install python `conda install "python>=3.7.11,<3.10.0"`
4. clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/TuragaLab/flyvis.git`
5. navigate to the repo `cd flyvis` and install in developer mode `pip install -e .`
6. (run `pytest` to check if the installation works)

## Catch up on the background üê¶

How useful is a connectome? We show that you can predict quite a bit about the neural activity of a circuit from just measurements of its connectivity.

We built a convolutional recurrent network of the fly visual system--on a hexagonal grid, matching the columnar structure of the optic lobe. Weights (connections + filter weights) come from the connectome: A deep neural network which precisely maps onto a real brain circuit!

Our connectome-constrained ‚Äúdeep mechanistic network‚Äù (DMN) has 64 identified cell-types, 44K neurons + over 1 Mio. connections.
We trained its free parameters (single-cell + synapse dynamics) on optic flow
computation from naturalistic movie inputs.
